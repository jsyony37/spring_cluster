To use other first principles codes besides QE or VASP, it is possible
to give the cluster_spring code Atoms objects, modified for use with this code.

The basic usage is to declare Atoms objects, using data from some
external source, and pass them to cluster_spring like you would with
QE input/output files or VASP POSCARs/OUTCARs

See the example example_othercodes for more information

For example:

from atoms_kfg import Atoms

pos_distorted = np.array([[0,0,0],[0,0,0.101]],dtype=float)
energy_distorted=0.0005000000
forces_distorted = np.array([[0,0,0.1],[0,0,-0.1]],dtype=float)
stress_distorted = np.array([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,-1.000000000000000e-04]],dtype=float)

distorted = Atoms(scaled_positions=pos_distorted,
                  symbols=['N','N'],
                  cell=A,
                  forces=forces_distorted,
                  stress=stress_distorted,
                  energy=energy_distorted)


...

e,f,s,er,fr,sr = mysc.calc_energy_qe_file(distorted)
