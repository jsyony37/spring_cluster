# you also need a FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD file, which the code can also generate

# Usage
# python make_sheng.py t.2nd.fc outstring 20 20 20

# shengBTE is a 3rd party Boltzman transport equation solver for the thermal conductivity and other properties.
# this code can do the functions of thirdorder (distributed with shengBTE), plus the QE phonon calculation part.
