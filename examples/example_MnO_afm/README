MnO rocksalt example, treating magnetic + structural degrees of freedom.

We expand around the cubic rocksalt FM phase. The ground state is AFM rhombohedral rocksalt.

The spin expansion only can occur at even orders, due to up to down spin symmetry.

Currently the code only fits collinear spins, treating them like Ising variables. It can run 
Monte Carlo treating the spins like classical Heisenberg spins (fixed unit magnitude, s1 dot s2 vector interactions) or Ising variables (1 or -1).
