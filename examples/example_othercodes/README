This example shows how to run cluster_spring with other sources of forces/energies/stresses besides QE or VASP

It uses a fake example to show how to setup Atoms objects using fake
forces/energies/stresses, but you will have to get this data from somewhere to run the code

run_othercode_zeff.py show the same thing with nonzero dielectric
constant/born effective charges.
