This fits the 2D square lattice FM Ising model to 'fake' model data
and then runs Monte Carlo on the model. 

H = -J Sum_ij s_i s_j

It can also run MC on the Heisenberg model by allowing the spin
directions to rotate in 3D with constant magnitude.

H = -J Sum_ij svec_i dot svec_j


To be clear, the MC code in this code is currently purely
classical. This makes no difference to the Ising model because if
there is no transverse field, everything commutes in the Ising model,
but will change the results of the Heiseberg model.
