Fits a higher order model to the MgO-CaO system. The fitting data
includes significantly larger distortions than in the Si-Ge system.

As written, run_mgo_cao6.py allows distortions in atomic displacments
up to 6th order, and may take an hour or two to fit. If you comment
out the 5th and 6th order distortions, it will run faster, but the fit
won't be quite as good.
