Examples list

example_Si :	       Harmonic and cubic fitting/testing of Si. Includes phonon
	               band structure, DOS, elastic constants, etc

example_SiGe :         Harmonic and cubic fitting of Si-Ge system. Also shows
                       an example of a simple Monte Carlo run.

example_Al_vacancy :   Harmonic and cubic fitting of Al + vacancy

example_MgO_CaO :      Fit rocksalt oxide system. Introduces Born effective
		       charges/dielectric constants and much larger
		       distortions and higher order interactions than
		       in previous examples

example_Ising_model :  A toy example that fits the Ising model from
                       non-first principles data and runs Monte Carlo.
                       Does not include any atomic displacments, only
                       spin-spin terms.

example_Si_recursive : Fits a higher order model for Si, and then
                       attempts to improve it recursively by
                       generating new structures with Monte Carlo
                       sampling at 500K, doing new DFT calculations,
                       and incorporating the new data into an improved
                       model all automatically

example_tools :        How to use the generation tools for quickly making QE
	       	       inputfiles that are useful in fitting. Most of
	       	       the commands also work naturally with VASP
	       	       POSCARs

example_SiGe_vasp :    Shows how to run an example using VASP POSCARS and
                       OUTCARS. There is very little change from the user's prospective

example_othercodes :   Shows how to run a fake example using data from
		       an unsupported first princples code or other
		       source of energies, forces, and stresses. if
		       you make a full interface for another code, let
		       me know.
