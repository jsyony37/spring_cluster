Examples list

example_Si :           Harmonic and cubic fitting/testing of Si. Includes phonon band structure, DOS, elastic constants, etc

example_SiGe :         Harmonic and cubic fitting of Si-Ge system. Also shows an example of a simple Monte Carlo run.

example_Al_vacancy :   Harmonic and cubic fitting of Al + vacancy

example_MgO_CaO :      Fit rocksalt oxide system. Introduces Born effective charges/dielectric constants and 
		       much larger distortions and higher order interactions than in previous examples

example_Ising_model :  A toy example that fits the Ising model from non-first principles data and runs Monte Carlo.
                       Does not include any atomic displacments, only spin-spin terms.

example_Si_recursive : Fits a higher order model for Si, and then attempts to improve it recursively by
                       generating new structures with Monte Carlo sampling at 500K, doing new DFT 
                       calculations, and incorporating the new data into an improved model all automatically

example_tools  :       How to use the generation tools for quickly making QE inputfiles that are useful in fitting
