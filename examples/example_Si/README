The files run_si_harmonic.py run_si_cubic.py  run_si_cubic_shorterrange.py 
will run harmonic only, harmonic + cubic, and shorter range harmonic+cubic models, respectively.

The harmonic model works very well on the small distortion training data (files_train_harm), 
but struggles somewhat with larger distortion testing data (files_test).

The harmonic + cubic model fits the data very well.

The shorter range harmonic + cubic model fits pretty well, but has worse 
energies/forces and worse elastic constants, because we are trying to ignore terms that are nonzero.
Of course, it also has about half the parameters to fit, so it requires less data to fit and will run faster.

The files also demonstrate some of the basic analysis tools, like phonon band structures, DOS, elastic constants, and 
Gruneisen parameters.

Expected output are in reference_files/ , and the DFT data is in data/
