This examples fits and tests a Si_(1-x)Ge_x  model.

run_sige_cubic.py - the main file
files_train - list of training data
files_test - list of testing data. Includes larger unit cells
data/ - holds the Quantum Espresso files we need

This example has a large number of proposed interactions (~500) and takes a while to fit.

We use recursive feature extraction to attempt to figure out the minimum number of 
proposed interactions we need to achieve good out of sample predictions. If you want
an even sparser model, you can directly specify the number of interaction to keep like:

mysc.set_regression('rfe',num_keep=NNN)

----

In the second example
run_sige_montecarlo.py

We fit a simpler model (harmonic terms only) and then run a short
Monte Carlo sampling. The model isn't really robust enough to run at
400 K and the unit cell size and number of MC steps are not converged,
but this will give you an idea of how to do MC sampling.
